hey, hi! i'm miley. i go by quite a few names, but that's the one most people use for me.
formerly @/beneaththeruins, now named after my favourite roblox game ^-^

icelandic canadian! i'm not nearly fluent enough to be an authority though, my main languages are french and english lol.. i use tonetags sometimes and especially when asked, i have trouble understanding sarcasm and literal vs not literal stuff

any/all pronouns or she/her, whatever works.

i like entropy zero, and you will usually see me cosplaying its characters in most games i play. aiden is very me unfortunately (no im not a kinnie, stop asking /lh)

i dont have a dni, or anything like it. if i dont wanna talk, i just wont
