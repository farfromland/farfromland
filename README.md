this is my ponytown-centric account forgive me

I LIKE BEING FRENDS WITH PEOPLE!!! feel free 2 friend me whenever!!!!

that one combine elite cosplayer you've probably seen before.. formerly beneaththeruins, if u know me from the phighting/roblox/mandela catalogue area..!

i often wont approach people on my own unless im crowning, sorry! i get uncomfortable very easily & feel the need to rewrite my bios/pages a lot to explain myself; generally know that i dont do a good job at portraying my personality. very different in person than in writing! also i have no real dni. if i dont wanna talk i wont

as much as i dislike the kin/therian community, i won't go out of my way to hurt people. not my jam. while i personally don't believe in the concept and have _very_ bad experiences with people in it i do my best not to bring it up. given i used to consider myself such, i do try to understand, but sometimes my frustrations can seep thru :(

while i am socially *anxious*, i'm not anti social. c+h is ALWAYS fine, and i won't bite you for standing over or touching my pixel horse (though i will usually move to make sure you aren't uncomfortable) as i promise it isn't that serious lol :-}
