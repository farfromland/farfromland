that one combine elite cosplayer you've probably seen before.. formerly beneaththeruins, if u know me from the phighting/roblox/mandela catalogue area..!

wont approach people a lot sorry. i get uncomfortable very easily & feel the need to rewrite my bios/pages a lot to explain myself, generally know that i dont do a good job at portraying myself. very different in person than in writing.

i avoid those in the tf2 safe area at all costs, but will often sit nearby so i can still find half life/other valve people (slowly switching to 18+).. you guys are freaks, dont touch me thanks
