unrelated side note.. i like reading rentrys n straws n bios n stuff. chances r if you have one i have read it! i do my best to be mindful of boundaries and preferences, tho i can slip up sometimes. dont be afraid 2 let me know when i do.

im starting to not gaf about identity stuff.. like so long as it isnt harmful 2 u or anyone else, its not my business. i can spend my time worryin bout actually important things.
