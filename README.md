hi, i'm miley (but i also go by ethan)! i prefer people interacting w/ me rather than judging based on my writing style, cause i do my best to match vibes. my writing does not convey how excitable a person i am *(i do still have prns.cc linked if u wanna read that thoug.. sighs dramatically)*


dx. severe social & general anxiety, audhd, and working on bpd. i suffer quite extreme mood and opinion swings/changes! nothing personal! i also dont usually follow people on socials. *doesnt mean i dont like u if i unfollow!!!* my opinions are not binded to that haha 


*(but yeah, i don't like fictionkin or most otherkin. if u interact with me regardless of that then i will point and laugh, youre not "standing up for urselves" like you think you are lmfao)*


..usually in these skinz if you do wanna chat..
