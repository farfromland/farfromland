hi! i'm miley/ethan! feel free to also call me the name of the character i'm cosplaying
*she/her or any/all*, whatever you'd like. aroace and very loud about it

***important***: i have severe social anxiety and a few other clinical diagnoses, so please be aware that this impacts how i interact with people!!! i'm awful at picking up on social cues, double meanings, and non-literal sentences, and i am VERY VERY AWKWARD. i talk a lot to fill the quiet, even when i'm not sure what to say - apologies in advance if i talk over you by accident, it's a habit i'm wokring on fixing! may go quiet sometimes, not your fault.

no dni, if i dont wanna talk i wont! kinda sorta block freely

***for ponytown***: c+h (cuddle/hiding behind or with my pony) is ALWAYS OK!!!! yep, even when i have "dniuf" or anything like it in my name. like i said im really awkward so im perfectly ok with you initating those interactions and stuff. i wont usually whisper people unless im complimenting or crowning (and maybe to joke around sometimes, i am trying to get outta my shell a little!) :)

spins are terraria, fnaf and entropy zero ask me about them if you dare /silly
