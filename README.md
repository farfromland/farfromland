hi, i'm miley (but you can also call me ethan). not writing a lot here because i'd much rather people get to know me rather than making assumptions based on my writing style- i always try to match vibes (and i'm actually a *super* energetic person), and when i'm not interacting my writing doesn't reflect that very well (ie, i sound like a pretentious prick lol).

byi: i'm diagnosed audhd and severe social anxiety, working on and figuring out a personality disorder/bpd too, though i don't have the diagnosis for that yet. please keep in mind my moods swing a lot- i don't mean to hurt people, and i do my best to refrain from interacting if i'm upset (though let it be known i have slipped up before- apologies). please take anything i say when i'm "angry" with a grain of salt, and please tell me if i've hurt you. i don't ever mean to, and i will always do my best to make it up to you, even if it takes a little time. i'm a big people pleaser.

i go out of my way to avoid fictionkin, often times. this isn't personal (i don't even hate you guys), i'm just extremely wary after so many very poor interactions. my own beliefs don't really matter, and i won't argue over them, so please don't try starting beef with me over this.

..usually in these skinz if you do wanna chat ^^
