hi, i'm miley (but you can also call me ethan). not writing a lot here because i'd much rather people get to know me rather than making assumptions based on my writing style- i always try to match vibes, and when i'm not interacting my writing doesn't reflect that very well (ie, i sound like a pretentious prick lol).

byi: i'm diagnosed audhd, working on and figuring out a personality disorder/bpd too, though i don't have the diagnosis for that yet. please keep in mind my moods swing a lot- i don't mean to hurt people, and i do my best to refrain from interacting if i'm upset (though let it be known i have slipped up before- apologies). please take anything i say when i'm "angry" with a grain of salt, and please tell me if i've hurt you. i don't ever mean to, and i'll do my best to make it up to you.

i go out of my way to avoid fictionkin, usually. this isn't personal (i don't even hate you guys), i'm just extremely wary after so many very poor interactions. my own beliefs don't really matter, and i won't argue over them. please don't try starting beef with me over this.
