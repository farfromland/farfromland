that combine elite cosplayer u've probably seen before (MASSIVE entropy zero fan, especially the 2nd game)

very likely to be callous and distant when talking at first. i don't like the majority of people in ponytown, *especially* in fandom areas, which leads me to being extremely wary around others. i'm also diagnosed with severe social anxiety, so please keep in mind that it will impact how i talk and act.

despite all of that, you can usually tell when i've warmed up, as i'm a very different person from how i often present myself (me yapping a ton around you is a big sign i'm comfortable).

i apologize in advance if i accidentally talk over you- it's something i'm working on, and a part of my other conditions. i don't mean to be rude.
